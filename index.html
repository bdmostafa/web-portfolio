           <h3>Designer, Front-end Developer & SEO Expert</h3>
           <p><b>I design, code and develop beautifully simple things, and I have passionate what I do.</b> As starting my journey as a freelance developer nearly 3 years ago, I have done remote work for companies, consulted for startups, communicate and collaborated with multi-talented people to create digital products, software applications for both businesses and consumer perspectives. </p><p>I am quietly energetic, mostly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on advancing my chops one design problem at a time. I like to code anything else from scratch, enjoy bringing ideas, and applying them to the real world life in the cloud world.</p>

            <h2> Front-end Developer</h2>
            <p><b>Generally, every website should be built with two primary objectives. </b> Firstly, it needs to work across all devices I mean responsive. Secondly, its loding speed needs to be fast as possible. Having a fast-speed website is the key to keeping people around which ultimately converts them into clients. There are a countless of techniques engaged in making a super fast website, all of which I have spent years learning and practicing. </p>
           </p>I build these espertise into every site I code and can also offer this as a standalone service for existing websites as well.</p>

            <p>Most of the time, deployment sucks. Using a continuous integration app can help automate your deployments so you can focus on writing code and buildings things. In this regard, Iâ€™ll show you how to set up a basic web project with HTML and CSS so that publishing your code is as simple as pushing to GitHub.</p>
